# Project1FitnessAdvisor
Author: Zakaria Bouaddou

Project Objective:

This project aims to provide users with a more personalized health and fitness experience by going beyond the traditional Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation. Instead of relying solely on basic BMI metrics, users will have the opportunity to input and track additional data, including muscle mass and body fat levels. By offering more tailored and specific feedback, this program helps individuals gain a better understanding of their overall fitness and progress, resulting in more informed health decisions and a customized approach to personal fitness goals.
