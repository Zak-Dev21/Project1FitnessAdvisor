Author: Zakaria Bouaddou

Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Fitness Tracking and Recommendation System that empowers users to monitor their health metrics, particularly Body Mass Index (BMI), muscle, and fat levels. This interactive software application provides personalized fitness recommendations based on user inputs, helping individuals make informed decisions about their exercise routines and dietary habits. The system aims to achieve the following specific goals:

    1. User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and interactive user interface that allows users to easily input their physical metrics, such as height, weight, muscle, and fat levels.

    2. BMI Calculation: Implement a reliable algorithm to calculate the userâ€™s BMI based on their height and weight, categorizing them into different health ranges (underweight, healthy, overweight, obese).

    3. Personalized Recommendations: Provide tailored fitness and nutritional recommendations based on the user's BMI, muscle, and fat levels, ensuring that users receive guidance that is suitable for their individual health status and fitness goals.

    4. Progress Tracking: Allow users to track their fitness progress over time by storing up to ten entries of their BMI, muscle levels, and fat levels. Users can view their historical data to monitor improvements or changes in their fitness journey.

    5. Exercise Suggestions: Offer users targeted exercise recommendations based on their identified weak muscle groups. This feature aims to enhance their workout routines and ensure a balanced approach to strength training.

    6. Validation and Error Handling: Incorporate input validation mechanisms to ensure that user inputs for measurements and levels are positive and within defined limits, enhancing the reliability and user experience of the application.

    7. Engagement through Randomized Motivation: Generate random suggestions for exercise days to encourage users to engage in physical activities regularly, fostering a proactive approach to fitness.

    8. Health Considerations: Integrate health condition checks that provide additional recommendations for users with specific health concerns (e.g., diabetes, heart conditions), ensuring that advice aligns with their medical needs.

    9. Documentation and Code Clarity: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the codebase and implement clear, well-structured coding practices, making the application maintainable and scalable for future enhancements.

    10. Future Expansion: Lay the groundwork for potential future enhancements, such as integrating with wearable fitness devices or providing an online platform for community support and motivation.

By fulfilling these objectives, the Fitness Tracking and Recommendation System aims to support users in their journey towards better health and fitness, ultimately leading to improved well-being and quality of life.
